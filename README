# THOSEKIDS PLUGIN
# DoPrettyUrls

This "do" plugin provides a customized +to_param+ method to override typical
id-based URL construction. The goal is to provide an higher-visibility SEO,
as well as URLS which are recognizable and memorable.

Classes which specify this plugin must have a +name+ property, or override the
vanity field when defining. The vanity property will be combined with the +id+
property to build a memorable +to_param+.

#
# EXAMPLE
#

  class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    # Use name field for vanity generation:
    do_pretty_urls
  end
  
  class MyOtherModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    # Specify a field for vanity use:
    do_pretty_urls :column => :other_field_name
  end
